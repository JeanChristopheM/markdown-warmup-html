            <h2>A funny story</h2>
            <p>One day I was sleeping in a caravan in the garden and I decided to fall asleep with some music on Youtube.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately my phone had enough battery to last all night and kept on going through the Youtube algorithm the whole night.</p>
            <p>I eventually woke up around 5am to what sounded like a team of people fighting and yelling in some foreign language.</p>
            <p>The stress rose quickly and I jumped out of my bed to investigate !</p>
            <p>As soon as I walk out the caravan door, my feet slide on the frozen water on the ground (winter can be rough) and I literally flip up and fall flat on the ground with my head hitting it relatively hard.</p>
            <p>I later realized it was my phone displaying a football match in arabic language...</p>
            <p>My family found it HILARIOUS at my expense so I hope you will too ðŸ¤—</p>
            <h4>TL;DR : Felt asleep with youtube running, woke up to a football match and thought it was people outside. When I ran out I slid on ice and felt HARD on the ground. I felt rather dumb...</h4>
