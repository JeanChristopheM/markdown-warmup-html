## You can always count on me when

If you have general computer issues on a windows machine I can help !

Also if you have trouble with English to French or French to English translations, I will gladly give you a hand.

When it comes to coding I usually have a strong logic so maybe I can help with that too ?
In any case, don't hesitate to reach out üòâ.

## A funny story

One day I was sleeping in a caravan in the garden and I decided to fall asleep with some music on Youtube.

Unfortunately my phone had enough battery to last all night and kept on going through the Youtube algorithm the whole night.

I eventually woke up around 5am to what sounded like a team of people fighting and yelling in some foreign language.

The stress rose quickly and I jumped out of my bed to investigate !

As soon as I walk out the caravan door, my feet slide on the frozen water on the ground (winter can be rough) and I literally flip up and fall flat on the ground with my head hitting it relatively hard.

I later realized it was my phone displaying a football match in arabic language...

My family found it HILARIOUS at my expense so I hope you will too ü§ó

##### TL;DR : Felt asleep with youtube running, woke up to a football match and thought it was people outside. When I ran out I slid on ice and felt HARD on the ground. I felt rather dumb...
